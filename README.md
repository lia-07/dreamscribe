## Setup instructions

If I haven't hosted this somewhere, you can run the project by following these steps

1. Download this repo (if you have the GitHub CLI installed, you can use a terminal to run `gh repo clone lia-skl/dreamscribe` in the folder you'd like to save it to).
2. Assuming you have Node JS and NPM installed, using a terminal, enter the `dreamscribe` folder you have downloaded and then run `npm install` .
3. Then, you simply need to run `npm run dev -- --open` and it should pop up in your browser.
