  <p>
    Dreamscribe is a free dream journaling web app that values your privacy. We want you to feel
    secure when writing out the contents of your dreams on our platform, and so none of your data at <i
      >all</i
    > is stored or collected by us or any third party. All of your journal entries are stored in your
    browser's local storage.
  </p>
  <p>
    We committed to maintaining the utmost respect for your privacy while providing a seamless and
    simple user experience. We firmly uphold our promise that no trace of any of any of your journal
    entries leave insides of your browser, unless you choose to download them and publish them
    elsewhere. The dreamscribe experience is powered entirely by in-browser technology, and there is
    no server processing of your journal entries.
  </p>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy is subject to change, but we promise to always provide you control of what
    happens with your data, no matter what.
